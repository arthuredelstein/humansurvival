# Survival Scoreboard

The goal of Survival Scoreboard project is to provide a simple overview of humanity's progress toward protecting the long-term survival of our species.

We want this overview to be simple, pragmatic, systematic, up-to-date and actionable:
* Simple because human survival is ultimately a political problem and thus requires the coordinated efforts of journalists, activists, politicians and ordinary people around the world.
* Pragmatic because hoping for a moral transformation in human beings is not a strategy.
* Systematic because we need to understand the big picture to know where to focus our efforts.
* Up-to-date: the ongoing effort to ensure human survival can be helped by letting the public know when progress has been made.
* Actionable: for anyone joining the effort to ensure human survival -- it should be clear where the gaps are and thus where political effort must be focused.

In general, politics is a feedback loop between governments and the people. People
learn what their government is doing, and if they are dissatisfied, they
attempt to steer their government towards an improved outcome. As with any
feedback loop, it's necessary to measure the current state of the system (the "process variable") and compute it's difference (the "error signal") from where we want to be ("the setpoint").

By displaying the data in a table that compares different countries, we also
encourage a (hopefully friendly) competition. 

## Methodology

To ensure that the human species continues, we need to establish a system of constraints that ensures that the mass destruction of humans or our civilization does not occur. Destruction could take the form of a natural event (such as an asteroid impact), or a human-initated incident, whether deliberate or accidental.

Here we focus on the most likely forms of human extinction or near-extinction:

1. Nuclear war (accidental or deliberate)
2. Pandemic (natural or engineered)
3. Ecosystem collapse
4. Hostile artificial intelligence
5. Asteroid impact
6. Mass repression leading to genocide

While we don't know the exact probabilities of these threats, it is plausible that any of them could cause the destruction of the human species over the next century. [Here cite other sources for these threats.]

In order to protect against these threats, we need an international effort to prevent these threats from arising in the first place. Most global international agreements that exist today to address threats of this nature are in the form of treaties and conventions facilitated by the United Nations.

### Nuclear war

A number of treaties have been created at the UN to prevent nuclear war. In this project, we focus major treaties that appear to be the most likely to reduce the likelihood of nuclear war:
* Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
* Non-proliferation Treat (NPT)
* Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)
* Membership of Nuclear Weapons-Free Zones

It is quite likely that nuclear war could arise from the escalation of a conventional war. In addition, the threat of conventional war is one of the reasons that some states maintain a nuclear deterrent. Unfortunately, the "Security Dilemma" implies that a nuclear deterrent from one state can be perceived by others as a nuclear threat. So we decided to include treaties that provide an alternative deterrent to aggressive war:

* Rome Treaty, establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC), which punishes, and thus deters, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
* Aggression Amendment to the Rome Treaty, adding the Crime of Aggression to the ICC's jurisdiction, to deter the invasion of one state by another.

### Pandemic

The danger of pandemics has become all too familiar in the world following the experience of COVID-19. Two possible sources of pathogens are worth considering: natural and human-engineered. The category of human-engineered pathogens can be both accidental and deliberate spread. The latter (intentional) are frequently called biological weapons. The development of such bioweapons is prohibited by the Biological Weapons Convention, introduced in 1972 and first in effect in 1975.

Accidental pathogens and natural pathogens are also highly important source of civilization-endangered pandemics. The World Health Organization has primary responsibility for protecting the world against such pandemics. All nations apart from Liechtenstein are members of the WHO, so membership is currently not included in our table.

### Ecosystem collapse

The threat of collapse of large numbers of species or whole ecosystems is not merely a threat to Earth's natural heritage, but also a threat to the survival of the human species. Humanity's reliance on nature for its sustenance is indisputable and highly
complex -- we can't risk allowing the destruction of the biological world.

### Other threats not included here

Asteroid impact, ...


### Alternative points of view on human threats and the right way to address them

International politics and the trajectory of history is by its nature unpredictable
and impossible to reduce to a simple formula. Obviously, the simple formula
used by this project to gives national governments a score for their contribution
to human survival is highly incomplete. In reality, many more factors will be
highly important in how the future plays out.

My hope is merely that this project points to some significant steps that 
national governments could take to reduce existential risks.

I encourage discussion and debate! Not everyone will agree that treaties are
the right approach to reduce humanity's risk of extinction or near extinction.
Others will disagree that the treaties chosen on this site are the right ones.
I believe it's important to listen to those voices with an open mind, and I
hope all discussion will be respectful and kind even when disagreements are
strong.

### Implications for my feelings of national pride.

No country is perfect. Most people love the country where they live -- this is
right and good provided we remember that that love is despite our country's
imperfections.
