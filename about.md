# About SurvivalScores.org

Humanity won't last forever -- but let's try! The goal
of the SurvivalScores project is to provide a clear overview of humanity's
progress toward protecting the long-term survival of our species.

To reduce the really big risks to humanity, we need international cooperation.
That's because a threat to human survival might emerge from any individual country
or region, whether through war, environmental degradation, viral
outbreak or hostile AI, but expand to threaten the globe.

The primary venue for international cooperation is, of
course, the United Nations, and the instrument through which such protective
cooperation is established and codified is, naturally, the international treaty. Therefore, SurvivalScores.org presents a daily snapshot of the current state of
international treaties critical to the survival of humanity.

The degree to which countries have signed and ratified these treaties is a pretty direct measure of our species' progress toward mitigating existential threats. When a country joins a treaty, it earns a green check; if a country is not yet a
member of treaty, it is given a red X.

We assign each country a crude score, which is merely a count of how many
treaties the country has already joined. Ideally, this table serves as a 
scoreboard that encourages friendly competition between nations to be among
those most conscientiously supporting human survival.

## Methodology

To ensure that the human species continues, we need to establish a system of worldwide constraints to reduce the likelihood of the mass destruction of our species or of our civilization. Destruction could take the form of a natural event (such as an asteroid impact), or a human-initiated incident, whether deliberate or accidental.

Here we focus on the most likely forms of human extinction or near-extinction.
These include:
1. Nuclear war
2. Pandemic
3. Ecosystem collapse
4. Hostile artificial intelligence

While we don't know the exact probabilities of these threats, it is plausible that any of them could cause the destruction of the human species over the next century.

International efforts to protect our species against these threats are ongoing,
some for many decades. In order to protect against these threats, we need an international effort to prevent these threats from arising in the first place. Most global international agreements that exist today to address threats of this nature are in the form of treaties and conventions facilitated by the United Nations.

### Nuclear war

A number of treaties have been created at the UN to prevent nuclear war. In this project, we focus major treaties that appear to be the most likely to reduce the likelihood of nuclear war:
* Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
* Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT)
* Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)
* Membership of Nuclear Weapons-Free Zones

It is quite likely that nuclear war could arise from the escalation of a conventional war. In addition, the threat of conventional war is one of the reasons that some states maintain a nuclear deterrent. Unfortunately, the "Security Dilemma" implies that a nuclear deterrent from one state can be perceived by others as a nuclear threat. So we decided to include treaties that provide an alternative deterrent to aggressive war:

* Rome Treaty, establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC), which punishes, and thus deters, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
* Aggression Amendment to the Rome Treaty, adding the Crime of Aggression to the ICC's jurisdiction, to deter the military invasion of one state by another.

### Pandemic

The danger of pandemics has become all too familiar in the world following the experience of COVID-19. Two possible sources of pathogens are worth considering: natural and human-engineered.

The category of human-engineered pathogens can be both accidental and deliberate spread. The latter (intentional) are frequently called biological weapons. The development of such bioweapons is prohibited by the Biological Weapons Convention, introduced in 1972 and first in effect in 1975.

Accidental pathogens and natural pathogens are also highly important source of civilization-endangered pandemics. The World Health Organization has primary responsibility for protecting the world against such pandemics. All nations apart from Liechtenstein are members of the WHO, and Liechtenstein cooperates with the WHO, so our table doesn't currently
include membership of the organization.

### Ecosystem collapse

The threat of collapse of large numbers of species or whole ecosystems is not merely a threat to Earth's natural heritage, but also a threat to the survival of the human species. Humanity's reliance on nature for its sustenance is indisputable and highly complex: we can't risk allowing the destruction of our ecological support system.

To measure international commitment to combating this risk, we include the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity. These two treaties represent fundamental measures that all countries should jointly take to reduce humanity's devastating impact on the global ecosystem.

### Artificial Intelligence

The danger of artificial intelligence (AI) is only now emerging. No UN
treaties currently address this danger, but there is an ongoing effort to develop
international restrictions on the development and use of autonomous weapons. Once
such a treaty exists, we will add it to our table.

## Alternative points of view on human threats and the right way to address them

International politics and the trajectory of history is by its nature unpredictable
and impossible to reduce to a simple formula. Obviously, the simple formula
used by this project to gives national governments a score for their contribution
to human survival is highly incomplete. In reality, many more factors will be
highly important in how the future plays out.

I encourage discussion and debate! Not everyone will agree that treaties are
the right approach to reduce humanity's risk of extinction or near extinction.
Others will disagree that the treaties chosen on this site are the right ones.
I believe it's important to listen to those voices with an open mind, and I
hope all discussion will be respectful and kind even when disagreements are
strong.
