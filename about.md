# Human Survival Dashboard

The goal of Human Survival Dashboard project is to provide a simple overview of humanity's progress toward the long-term survival of our species.

We want this overview to be simple, pragmatic, systematic, up-to-date and actionable:
* Simple because human survival is ultimately a political problem and thus requires the coordinated efforts of journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens
* Pragmatic because hoping for a moral transformation in human beings is not a strategy
* Systematic because we need to understand the whole picture to understand where to focus our efforts
* Up-to-date: the ongoing effort to ensure human survival can be helped by letting the public know when progress is made.
* Actionable: for anyone joining the effort to ensure human survival -- it should be clear where the gaps are and thus where political effort must be focused.

## Methodology

To ensure that the human species continues, we need to establish a system of constraints that ensures that the mass destruction of humans or our civilization does not occur. Destruction could take the form of a natural event (such as an asteroid impact), or a human-initated incident, whether deliberate or accidental.

Here we focus on the most likely forms of human extinction or near-extinction:

1. Nuclear war (accidental or deliberate)
2. Pandemic (natural or engineered)
3. Ecosystem collapse
4. Hostile artificial intelligence
5. Asteroid impact
6. Mass repression leading to genocide

While we don't know the exact probabilities of these threats, it is plausible that any of them could cause the destruction of the human species over the next century. [Here cite other sources for these threats.]

In order to protect against these threats, we need an international effort to prevent these threats from arising in the first place. Most global international agreements that exist today to address threats of this nature are in the form of treaties and conventions facilitated by the United Nations.

### Nuclear war

A number of treaties have been created at the UN to prevent nuclear war. In this project, we focus on some of the major treaties that appear to be the most impact for reducing the likelihood of nuclear war:
* Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
* Non-proliferation Treat (NPT)
* Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)
* Membership of Nuclear Weapons-Free Zones

It is quite likely that nuclear war could arise from the escalation of a conventional war. In addition, the threat of conventional war is one of the reasons that some state maintain a nuclear deterrent. Unfortunately, the "Security Dilemma" implies that a nuclear deterrent from one state can be perceived by others as a nuclear threat. So we decided to include other treaties that deter aggressive war:

* Rome Treaty, establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC), which punishes (and thus deters), war crimes and crimes against humanity.
* Aggression Amendment to the Rome Treaty, adding the Crime of Aggression to the ICC's jurisdiction, deterring the invasion of one state by another.
