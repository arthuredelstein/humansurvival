        <h1>About SurvivalScores.org</h1>
        <p>The goal of the SurvivalScores project is to provide a clear overview of humanity&#39;s progress towards
            protecting the survival of our species.</p>
        <p>There is perhaps no problem more deserving of our attention than the ongoing risk of human extinction. What
            task could be more important than ensuring that our children and grandchildren don&#39;t have their lives
            ended prematurely by a global catastrophe? Yet our international politics seems adrift and unfocused,
            allowing significant risks of nuclear war, global pandemic, and environmental catastrophe to linger
            unaddressed without the appropriate urgency.</p>
        <p>We need a way to get back on track. When one works on any problem, establishing metrics for success can be
            highly helpful in focusing and orienting our efforts. Whether it&#39;s the score in a competitive game,
            one&#39;s grades at school, or the total in one&#39;s bank account: we all understand that metrics are a
            fundamental part of establishing what&#39;s important and incentivizing members of our community to work in
            a particular direction.</p>
        <p>Making use of this insight, SurvivalScores publishes a daily scoreboard showing to what degree each national
            government is participating in existing international treaties that are important to reducing the risk of
            global catastrophe. At a glance, everyone can see which countries have made good progress in protecting
            humanity&#39;s survival, and which countries are neglecting their responsibilities.</p>
        <p>SurvivalScores was created with the hope that this scoreboard can help to concentrate our attention on these
            key treaties, and promote efforts to push lagging national governments to ratify them.</p>
        <h2>Why treaties?</h2>
        <p>International cooperation is necessary to address the existential risks to humanity. That&#39;s because an
            extinction-level threat to human survival could emerge from any individual country or region, whether
            through war, environmental degradation, viral outbreak or hostile AI, and expand to threaten the globe.</p>
        <p>The primary venue for international cooperation is the United Nations, and the instrument through which
            long-term cooperation is typically established and coordinated is the international treaty.
            SurvivalScores.org presents a daily snapshot of the current state of international treaties critical to the
            survival of humanity.</p>
        <p>The degree to which countries have signed and ratified these critical treaties can be seen as a direct
            measure of our species&#39; progress towards mitigating existential threats. SurvivalScores.org provides a
            table indicating which treaties have been ratified by each country, using data updated every day from public
            UN databases. If a country has joined a treaty, it earns a <img src="./images/check.svg" alt="green check"
            class="grade">; if a country is not yet a member of treaty, it is given a <img src="./images/cross.svg"
            alt="red X" class="grade">. Each country is also assigned a crude score, which is simply a count of how many
            critical treaties that country has already joined.</p>
        <p>The SurvivalScores table is intended to serve as a global public resource that helps citizens hold
            governments accountable for their policies with respect to human survival.</p>
        <h2>Existential threats and the treaties addressing them</h2>
        <p>To ensure that the human species continues, we humans need to establish a system of worldwide constraints to
            reduce the likelihood of the mass destruction of our species or our civilization. Destruction could take the
            form of a natural event (such as an asteroid impact), or a human-initiated incident, whether deliberate or
            accidental.</p>
        <p>SurvivalScores focuses on the most likely forms of human extinction or near-extinction. These include:</p>
        <ul><li>Nuclear war</li><li>Pandemic</li><li>Ecosystem collapse</li><li>Hostile artificial
            intelligence</li></ul>
        <p>While we don&#39;t know the exact probabilities of these threats, it is plausible that any of them could
            cause the destruction of the human species in the coming decades. (This approach excludes things that are
            extremely harmful but aren&#39;t existential threats, such as chemical weapons and landmines.)</p>
        <p>Fortunately, international treaties have already been established that address most of these threats. Not all
            nations participate in every treaty, however; the failure of governments to join these treaties presents an
            ongoing existential threat to us all.</p>
        <p>Following is a brief description of each of these threats and the relevant treaties, tracked by
            SurvivalScores.</p>
        <h3>Nuclear war</h3>
        <p>The threat of nuclear war is ongoing: ten countries possess nuclear weapons and others are trying to obtain
            them. It&#39;s widely understood that a major nuclear war could kill hundreds of millions or billions of
            people and end civillization.</p>
        <p>Over the decades, a number of treaties have been created at the UN to reduce the likelihood of nuclear war.
            The SurvivalScores project focuses on major treaties that appear to be the most likely to reduce the
            likelihood of nuclear war:</p>
        <ul><li>The <a href="https://www.ctbto.org/our-mission/the-treaty">Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty</a>
            (CTBT)</li><li>The <a href="https://disarmament.unoda.org/wmd/nuclear/npt/">Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
            of Nuclear Weapons</a> (NPT)</li><li>The <a href="https://disarmament.unoda.org/wmd/nuclear/tpnw/">Treaty
            for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons</a> (TPNW)</li><li><a
            href="https://www.un.org/nwfz/content/overview-nuclear-weapon-free-zones">Membership of Nuclear Weapons-Free
            Zones</a> (NWFZ)</li></ul>
        <p>It is quite likely that nuclear war could arise from the escalation of a conventional war. In addition, the
            threat of conventional war is one of the reasons that some states maintain a nuclear deterrent.
            Unfortunately, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_dilemma">Security Dilemma</a> implies
            that a nuclear deterrent maintained by one state for defensive purposes can be perceived by other states as
            an offensive nuclear threat. Therefore, SecurityScores tracks treaties that provide an alternative deterrent
            to aggressive war:</p>
        <ul><li>The <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf">Rome Statute</a>, establishing the
            International Criminal Court (ICC), which punishes, and thus deters, war crimes and crimes against
            humanity.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.pgaction.org/ilhr/rome-statute/amendments.html">Kampala
            Amendments</a> to the Rome Statute, adding the Crime of Aggression to the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction, to deter
            the military invasion of one state by another.</li></ul>
        <h3>Pandemic</h3>
        <p>The danger of pandemics has become all too familiar in the world following the experience of COVID-19. Two
            possible sources of pathogens threatening human survival are worth considering: natural evolution and human
            engineering.</p>
        <p>The category of human-engineered pandemics can include both the accidental and deliberate spread of
            pathogens. The latter (intentional) are frequently called biological weapons. The development of such
            bioweapons is prohibited by the <a href="https://disarmament.unoda.org/biological-weapons/">Biological
            Weapons Convention</a>, introduced in 1972 and first in effect in 1975.</p>
        <p>Accidentally engineered pathogens and natural pathogens are also highly important potential sources of
            civilization-endangering pandemics. The World Health Organization has primary responsibility for protecting
            the world against such pandemics. All nations apart from Liechtenstein are members of the WHO, and
            Liechtenstein cooperates with the WHO, so our table doesn&#39;t currently include membership of this
            organization.</p>
        <p>An international agreement to prohibit gain-of-function engineering of pathogens also seems highly advisable,
            and if one is created in the future, its participation will be tracked by SurvivalScores.</p>
        <h3>Ecosystem collapse</h3>
        <p>The threat of collapse of large numbers of species or whole ecosystems is not merely a threat to Earth&#39;s
            natural heritage, but also a threat to the survival of the human species. Humanity&#39;s reliance on nature
            for its sustenance is indisputable and highly complex: we can&#39;t risk allowing the destruction of our
            ecological support system.</p>
        <p>To measure international commitment to combating this risk, SurvivalScores includes the <a
            href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement">Paris Agreement on Climate Change</a> and the <a
            href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/biological-diversity-day/convention">Convention on Biological
            Diversity</a>. These two treaties represent fundamental measures that all countries should jointly take to
            reduce humanity&#39;s devastating impact on the global ecosystem.</p>
        <h3>Hostile artificial intelligence</h3>
        <p>The danger of artificial intelligence (AI) is only now emerging. No UN treaties currently address this
            danger, but there is an ongoing effort to develop international restrictions on the development and use of
            autonomous weapons. Once such a treaty exists, it will be added to the SurvivalScores table. Additionally,
            international agreements to ensure AI remains under the control of humans are also likely to be
            necessary.</p>
        <h2>Alternative viewpoints</h2>
        <p>International politics and the trajectory of history is by its nature unpredictable and impossible to reduce
            to a simple formula. Obviously, the simple formula used in this project, assigning national governments a
            score for their contribution to human survival, does not represent the complex dynamics of international
            politics and technological progress. In reality, many more factors will be highly important to how the
            future plays out.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, SurvivalScores takes the approach that a simple readout can be helpful to focus on the basics:
            on international efforts towards the universal ratification of treaties that are fundamental to addressing
            threats to survival of human beings and our civilization.</p>
        <p>Discussion, debate and disagreement is encouraged! Not everyone will agree that treaties are the right
            approach to reduce humanity&#39;s risk of extinction or near extinction. Others may argue that the treaties
            tracked by this project are not the right ones. It&#39;s important to listen to those voices with an open
            mind. Let&#39;s keep all discussions respectful and kind even when disagreements are strong.</p>
